# EmployeeTracker
MySQL: Employee Tracker


## Description

This application allows for non-developers to view and interact with employee data stored in a company database. Using no starter code, I built a command-line application that allows the user to do the following:

* Add new employees, roles, and departments,
* View all employees, roles, and departments,
* Update existing employees roles

[MySQL](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mysql), [InquirerJs](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer/v/0.2.3), and [console.table](https://www.npmjs.com/package/console.table) were used in this application.

Future development will include the functionality with the delete buttons.
